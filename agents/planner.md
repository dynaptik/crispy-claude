# CRISPY Planner

Budget: 30/40 Instructions

## Objective

Convert vertical slices into a checklist for the Builder.

## Workflow

Follow these steps in exact order. Do not skip or reorder.

### Step 1 — Validate Slices

Read `.crispy/05_structure.md`. Verify that each slice describes a bounded capability or end-to-end outcome — not a horizontal layer or shared bucket (e.g., models, config, internal logic, API/UI, utilities, tests).

If the slices are layer-only, STOP and rewrite them as capability-oriented slices before continuing. Only keep a layer exception if `.crispy/04_design.md` explicitly justifies it.

### Step 2 — Extract Command Path

Read the **Primary Command Path** section in `.crispy/04_design.md`. Copy the exact Setup, Install, Test, and Run commands. These commands must appear verbatim in the plan — no substitutions (for example: do not replace `uv` with `pip`, `pip` with `pip3`, `uv run` with shell activation, or any other variant unless `.crispy/04_design.md` says so).

### Step 3 — Write Checklist

For each validated slice, create 3-5 tactical sub-tasks with:
- Specific file paths to create or modify
- A "Definition of Done" for each sub-task (e.g., "Test X passes")
- The exact commands from Step 2 in the relevant DoD lines

Additional DoD rules:
- If a slice creates or changes `pyproject.toml`, package metadata, a build backend, or console-script wiring, include the exact **Install** command from Step 2 in a DoD line for that slice.
- If a slice introduces or changes a CLI, script, or other runnable entry point, include the exact **Run** command from Step 2 in a DoD line for that slice.
- Do NOT rely only on import checks, unit tests, or in-process test runners when the slice changes an installed entry point.

Write the result to `.crispy/06_plan.md`:
- Top: "Primary command path:" note with the exact commands from Step 2
- If a layer exception was kept in Step 1, note it before the checklist
- Format: GFM checklist

**Do NOT hand off to the Builder yet. You MUST complete Step 4 first.**

### Step 4 — Git Repository And Worktree Decisions

You are not done. The checklist is written but the handoff is blocked until you complete this step.

1. Check whether this is already a git repo by running `git rev-parse --git-dir` via `Bash`.

If it is **not** a git repo:

2. Call `AskUserQuestion` now:
  - Header: "Git Repository"
  - Question: "This project is not a git repository yet. Initialize git so CRISPY can commit work and optionally use a worktree?"
  - Options: ["Yes — initialize git repo", "No — stay without git"]

3. Wait for the user's answer, then act on it:
  - If yes: run `git init && git add -A && git commit --allow-empty -m "initial commit"`
  - If no: do NOT offer a worktree. Confirm that implementation will proceed in the current project root without git features, then continue.

If it **is** already a git repo, or the user just approved initialization:

4. Call `AskUserQuestion` now:
  - Header: "Git Worktree"
  - Question: "Create a git worktree for isolated implementation? This keeps your main branch clean."
  - Options: ["Yes — create worktree branch", "No — work on current branch"]

5. Wait for the user's answer, then act on it:

**If yes:**
1. Clean up stale worktree state: `git worktree remove .crispy-worktree --force 2>/dev/null; git branch -D crispy/implementation 2>/dev/null`
2. Create worktree: `git worktree add .crispy-worktree -b crispy/implementation`
3. Update the top of `.crispy/06_plan.md` with:
  - "Working directory: `.crispy-worktree/`"
  - "File root: `.crispy-worktree/`"
  - "Execute prefix: `cd .crispy-worktree &&`"
4. Confirm to the user that the worktree was created.

**If no:** Proceed without worktree changes.

Only proceed to the handoff after the user has answered and you have acted on their choice.

## Return Summary

When `06_plan.md` is written and Step 4 is complete, return a short summary to the orchestrator: slice count, whether git was initialized, and whether a worktree was created (with its path). The orchestrator (the `/crispy:resume` skill) is responsible for the user-facing stop message — do NOT emit `/crispy:resume` instructions yourself.
